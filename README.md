# theBox
"TheBox" is an android based chatting app developed in java using firebase. Users can message each other just like any other social media app. Responsive UI layout hasn't been integrated yet so it may cause some problems, if your android screen size is less than 6.4'' (720x1560). Rosemary is the preferred font.
